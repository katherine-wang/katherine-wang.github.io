                <div id="about">
                   On campus, I am involved in social entrepreneurship as a 2012-2013 Fellow and later Internal Director of the UC Berkeley chapter of Compass Fellowship, an organization that provides the framework for freshman fellows to create a business plan for their own socially-minded start-up in just one year. I am also Managing Editor and Layout Editor of <b>hardboiled</b>, the Asian Pacific American newsmagazine at UC Berkeley and an active member of the progressive Asian Pacific Islander (API) community on campus. In the past, I served as Logistics Committee Co-Chair and Arts & Media Committee Member of the 2014 Asian Pacific Islanders Issues Conference (APIICON) Planning Team. I have also mentored in Cal Vietnamese Student Association's VISION program for the past three years. I hope to pursue a degree in law in the future.
